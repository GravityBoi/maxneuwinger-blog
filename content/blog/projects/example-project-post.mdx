# Building a Real-time Chat Application with WebSockets

In this technical deep-dive, I'll share my experience building a real-time chat application using WebSocket technology and React. We'll explore the architecture decisions, implementation challenges, and lessons learned along the way.

## The Architecture

The application follows a microservices architecture with three main components:

1. WebSocket server for real-time communication
2. React frontend for the user interface
3. PostgreSQL database for message persistence

## Implementation Details

First, let's look at the WebSocket server implementation:

```typescript
import { WebSocketServer } from 'ws';

const wss = new WebSocketServer({ port: 8080 });

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  ws.on('message', (message) => {
    // Handle incoming messages
  });
});
```

## Lessons Learned

1. WebSocket connection management is crucial
2. Message queuing helps with scalability
3. Proper error handling is essential
