# WARNING: AI GENERATED PLACEHOLDER FOR NOW





This project was my first research paper. I started it during my bachelor's degree at Friedrich Alexander University (FAU) and later published it.

The work began at the Professorship for Open Source Software. We were researching better tools for data engineers, including a new Domain Specific Language (DSL). We realized we were guessing what makes data engineering difficult for new people, so we decided to collect data to find out.

## The Problem: What Mistakes Do Beginners Make?

Data in data science and AI is often not clean. Data scientists can spend a large part of their time just cleaning it. This means early mistakes in data engineering are very expensive. To build better tools and training, we needed to answer this question:

What are the most common programming mistakes made by beginners in data engineering?

## Our Method: A Systematic Literature Review

To answer this, I performed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR). This is a structured research method to find, filter, and analyze all relevant papers on a topic.

1.  Search: I looked in academic databases (like IEEE Xplore and Scopus) for papers about programming mistakes by "novices" or "students" in "data engineering," "data science," or related languages (Python, SQL, Java).
2.  Filter: I started with hundreds of papers. Using specific inclusion rules, I narrowed the list down to 21 main publications from 2003 to 2024.
3.  Analysis: I used thematic analysis to categorize every mistake mentioned in these papers. I repeated this until no new types of mistakes were found.

## Key Findings

We found that while beginners (mostly students in the studies) make many simple syntax errors, like missing semicolons, these are not the main problem. They are easy to find and fix.

The most serious and common mistakes were:

* Domain Specific Mistakes: These are unique to data engineering.
    * Dataset Misunderstandings: Not understanding the schema, using the wrong attribute, or hard coding values ('male'/'female' instead of 1/2).
    * Faulty Data Analysis Logic: Using pandas functions the wrong way (e.g., using `where()` for filtering instead of `filter()`).
    * Incorrect Data Handling: Not managing `NaN` values, which can quietly produce wrong results.
* Strategic Errors:
    * Suboptimal Coding: Using a slow `for` loop to go through a pandas DataFrame instead of a fast, vectorized operation.
    * Wrong Algorithm:Choosing an incorrect approach for the problem.

We combined all these findings into a 9 category classification of mistakes, covering everything from high level strategic errors to simple typos.

## Impact and Publication

This classification is not just theoretical. It provides a data based foundation for:
* Educators: To create courses that focus on these important, domain specific mistakes instead of just basic syntax.
* Tool Builders (like our group): To design languages (like Jayvee) and IDE features that can automatically find or prevent these common errors.

This work, "A Systematic Review of Common Beginner Programming Mistakes in Data Engineering," was accepted to the 2025 IEEE/ACM 37th International Conference on Software Engineering Education and Training (CSEE&T).

I presented this first paper in Ottawa, Canada, while I was still a bachelor's student.
